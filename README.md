# blockly-elev
An example of using Google's Blockly framework to teach students how to code. An elevator was chosen because an elevator's operation is familiar to all/most folks; thus making the focus of the game as the solution rather than a lengthy problem statement.

This game was intended as a potential contribution to https://code.org/ if/when they solicit for new contributions. The game is designed to be consistent with the hour-of-code and other games you might find on the site. The look and feel are a work-in-progress.

The aim of the game is to move persons from the floor they arrive in to their destination. How you achieve it is by 'programming' the elevator, adding a line or two of code to 'instruct/command' the elevator to take a certain action, such as open the elevator door or travel to a certain floor.

The game gets progressively difficult as you move from the 1st to the 8th level. While you move only one person across 2 floors in level 1, you have 18 persons across many floors at level 8.
